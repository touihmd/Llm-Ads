# LLM-ADS Protocol — Live MVP Demo

This interactive demo is the first working proof-of-concept of the LLM-ADS Protocol architecture.

## What This Demonstrates

The MVP makes the core architectural principle **visible and tangible**: the complete separation between the conversation space and the contextual window — the foundational guarantee of the protocol.

Open `index.html` in any browser. No server, no dependencies, no installation required.

## How to Use

Type any message in the conversation panel. Try topics such as **nutrition**, **startup**, **travel**, **health**, or **AI** to see the contextual window activate with SQL-scored content cards — while the conversation itself remains entirely ad-free.

## What You Will See

The left panel is the **Conversation Space** — pure AI responses, zero commercial content, architecturally sealed. The right panel is the **Contextual Window** — separate, consent-based, activated only by session context, with each card displaying its SQL Quality Score and the exact reason for its appearance.

The demo also includes an interactive breakdown of the SQL scoring model (6 dimensions, weighted) and the full AQIA multi-stakeholder governance structure.

## Technical Notes

Built in a single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript — zero external dependencies, no backend, no data collection of any kind. This is intentional: the MVP demonstrates the *concept*, not a production stack. Community developers are invited to build production implementations on top of the open protocol specification.

## Next Steps for Developers

The full protocol specification — architecture, SQL formula, AQIA governance framework, legal compliance analysis — is available in the `/docs` folder. Pull requests are welcome for implementations in Python, React, or any LLM integration layer.
